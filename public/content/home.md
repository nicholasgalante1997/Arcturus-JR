  Me, embarking on a crusade against Vercel's disposition to grossly overcomplicate modern web development.

This is a space I've created to share thoughts, opinions, technical essays, instructional guides, tirades, and anything that doesn't fit into a stricter category above.

It is customary on some software engineering individual contributor websites for there to be a <i style="color: var(--secondary-color)">Buy me a cup of coffee</i> link or a <b style="color: var(--secondary-color)">bitcoin wallet</b> present, for donations. I'm not a registered charity (snarky!), so in lieu of such, I'd ask that if your intention is to give me money because I have helped you in some manner, that you instead make a contribution to [VCA Charities](https://www.vcacharities.org/donations) which supports welfare for animals. Make a dog or a cat's day better.
