## Frameworks are commitments, and React has gone the way of the framework

> After writing this out more thoroughly, I'm realizing it's an excessively long tangent on how I strongly dislike Client Side Rendering, perhaps more generally React, and how I heavily prefer Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, even Isomorphic or Partial SSR is preferential in my opinion to Client Side Rendering. I just go on and on about it. If you do not have an interest in that, I do not blame you. Skip to the section entitled _Standardizing Project Setup_ below.

I'm not the biggest fan of react frameworks. In the beginning, way back, React was the _library_ for building user interfaces. It was unopinionated, and it was flexible. It did not seek to be a framework. As of yesterday, [React has gone ahead and deprecated create-react-app](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app), and this is objectively a great thing. There's no need for it anymore. But within the sunsetting blog post, I read the following,

> We recommend creating new React apps with a framework.

And this is a step in the wrong direction, from where we all needed React to go.

If you were someone who was excited about React Server Components or React Compiler after React Conf 2024 last year, odds are there is a bitter taste in your mouth right now. Where is the generalized support? It seems like if you want to use React Server Components, or the React Compiler, in non sandbox environments, you're forked if you're not willing to move your app over to a framework like next.js or remix/react-router [which seems intent to oscillate back and forth between each name annually like an Artist formerly known as Prince].  

I've posted some guides about how to get React Server Components up and running without using a framework, or how to leverage the experimental React Compiler in your build tooling using webpack and a custom babel loader, also not using a framework. But these solutions both suck. Both of these options are subpar and not primed for production; React wants you to use a framework. They want you on next.js or remix or whatever. They even said so in their [Sunsetting Create React App](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app) blog post.

I want you to rebel against this as hard as you can. I will help you. If your manager comes to and starts talking your ear off about this hot new React framework, send him my way. I'm foaming at the mouth for this opportunity.  

## React Framework Hate Fest 2025

_Why do you hate React frameworks, Nick? What did they do to you to deserve such an aversion?_

There's a number of reasons.  

### 1. Create-React-App brought about a culture of client side rendering

Create-React-App was a horrendous framework that survived for many years by preaching that it was itself in fact not a framework. By all proverbs, it resented it's own existence to the very end. Here's the positives; It spawned a wave of thousands, if not millions of React applications, a testament to the developers' natural ability to circumvent, and it reduced a lot of the boilerplate around react project scaffolding (this was it's largest purpose so it's unsurprising it retains this positive). Now, here's the ugly;

The pattern for configuring the development server and the SPA bundler was less than ideal. It felt wrong to need to bring in craco to customize the build process to your liking in a way that felt malleable. Not to mention, at reasonable scale, your entrypoints, even when optimized and split into chunks, or asynchronously loaded, were still massive and this felt like a never ending up-hill battle. Tweak the configuration, reduce the bundle size, add another feature or library, and rinse and repeat the whole thing. It was less than ideal.

It also felt like a miss that the bundler was largely Webpack for a vast majority of CRA's life.

> I have a lot of love for Webpack and what it is, what it has done for the growth of the web over the years. I have a lot of love for the maintainers, and there are various paradigms that have emerged out of Webpack, such as Module Federation, that have fundamentally advanced web development as we know it. But. The year is 2025. Javascript based compilers are a relic, and it's strictly due to performance. A lot of modern bundlers are moving over to languages like rust and go, for the performance improvement.

Client Side Rendering probably should never have been the default. The simplicity of the React-DOM Server API's surrounding static site generation and server side rendering are largely my basis for this claim. But I'll defend it in other ways; We had to get clever to produce SEO friendly pages with tools like React Helmet/etc, whereas with a SSG/SSR-first mentality, we likely can solve this SEO issue without the inclusion of external libraries (God, I hate next/head). We needed to invent mechanisms to client side route our applications, either leveraging react-router-dom, which promises to break its implementation API via a breaking change at least once every two years, or get clever and create custom implementations, whether stateful in approach, or using the History API, or using routing events, or whatever you get the point. You know how much thought goes into routing in an SSG situation? Like probably none. Same with SSR. It's an extension of the exercise of routing the server, which you already have a strategy for, Im sure.  

Let's go further. Performance. There really does become a point where performance becomes a real fucking pain in a client side rendered React environment. I've seen this at scale a number of times, but two where it became an actual issue. One was Amazon's Prime Gaming storefront, which was, at the time of my employment, a rather large client side rendered react app that was intensely media-heavy, and a number of these assets had to be fetched dynamically after initial entrypoint network calls, adding to the load time of the application. The second was a smaller [read _like 65 active users_] web3 application for a Blockchain Protocol company that is likely still spinning it's rudders, trying to figure out what it actually does. Despite it not having a massive userbase, their application had also reached a size of monolithic bloat so that it was also extremely slow to load across all networks and devices. They had also suffered from an enormous amount of media within the view on first paint in almost all of their views, [couldn't be saved by a good cache policy as the images themselves were highly dynamic (NFTs), I had quickly shifted a lot of their media to be lazy loaded, which helped a bit, like the way a bandaid can heal a broken a leg] and they had not yet discovered webpack chunking, so their initial entrypoint was enormous. Did a suite of audits on it across devices and I think the mean mobile time to interactive was ~36 seconds. Did you gasp audibly? I think ultimately, there are problems beyond react here at play, and I'm not 100% confident that, given how dynamic the app was intended to be, had it been ported to SSR or SSG that it would have seen an enormous amount of improvement.

Here are some commonalities that the two above scenarios shared, that are likely correlated to React and scaled applications (think monolith);

1. Massive React Component Hierarchies
   This one is self explanatory, and actually would have been potentially improved by either a static, server rendered, or partially isomorphic approach. It's pretty simple when you think about it. You've sent the client an html stub entrypoint that you're expecting to mount an application onto. You've got to load the JS needed to run the engine to build that application tree, all on the client's browser and typically not using Workers or other ways of offshooting heavy computational tasks, and then after building the application tree [which, as your app grows, this computation time increases], you'll need to convert the React fiber root (containing all the fiber nodes) to it's corresponding markup in the actual DOM to mount it to the existing markup entrypoint. It's a lot of JS work to perform before the user ever gets to see the application. This is a problem that could be solved by a static SSG/SSR approach, or a partially isomorphic approach, which allows less work to be performed on the client, sends a more complete skeleton of the dehydrated html (or in static apps, just sends the whole markup necessary to serve to the user), and hydration is typically a less computationally expensive task, and in affordance to the UI visibility can be considered non-blocking.  
2. CSS in JS Approaches to Styling (Styled-Components)
   I think the bigger issue that's being highlighted already, if you're a web dev person you might be seeing it, is a lot of react developers are not leveraging modern browser features that would improve their app's performance. We saw this above, with the failure to lazy load images using simple native html5 attributes. This is another case; Modern browsers are grossly overequipped to fetch and parse css files, generate a CSSOM, and attach styles to markup. Why are we not doing that? Why are we again using the javascript engine to do something that the browser does better, and in a more optimized way. We're blocking the JS engine on generating styles [and the larger the app, the longer this takes] and then these generated styles need to be attached to the DOM, and then and only then can they actually be parsed and added to their corresponding markup.  
3. Dynamic Media without Aggressive Caching
   1. 

### 2. Developers could have ate their peas

An entire generation of frontend developers felt they did not need to learn about the implementation specifics of React Server Side Rendering because Next.js and Gatsby did this for them, and it's so stupidly easy to have implemented on our own, that not learning it first hand has done us no favors. The React Server APIs and their corresponding informationa are literally fucking amazing. If all documentation was like React's, we'd live in a culture of software literacy that grossly surpassed english language or cultural literacy (I challenge you America to disprove this statement, you dumb giant cow).
