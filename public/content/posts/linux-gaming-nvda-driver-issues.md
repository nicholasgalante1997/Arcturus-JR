title: "Patching Boot Issues due to Nvidia Driver Optimizations on Ubuntu Linux"

> This will be a guide on how to resolve boot issues on your Ubuntu Linux system related to a potentially incorrect nvidia driver configuration or profile. Hope this helps!

I have a Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 laptop. Love it. Things heavy and the battery is fucking awful but it's actually overall a great machine. It's got an integrated Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU and a Ryzen 9 processor from the 7000 series (7940HS), and shipped with a Windows 11 OS. Thing is actually fairly elite, even for a 2 year old machine.

Well, I ripped out the windows 11 OS and installed a clean boot of Ubuntu 24.04, and used the DHH Omekase Linux setup to manage quick install/setup. I primarily used it for development, but more recently I've moved over to a POP_OS System76 machine, which is a little beefier. So, that free'd up the Zephyrus laptop a bit, and I wanted to repurpose it for some light gaming (Mostly Call of Duty, Black Ops II-6 Zombies), which I partly expected it to do pretty well.

To this extent, I went on to <claude.ai>, (<small>Because I'm the fucking worst, I don't know</small>), and I wanted to see if there were any performance optimizations I could make to the Zephyrus to better prep it to be used for gaming.  

> If anything, this has become a small anecdote regarding two things: one, the impossibility of determining certain One Way Doors versus Two Way Doors without walking through the Doorway, and two, the current state of llm psuedo-reasoning is an aggregate of a statistical means of data that represents the populace (there is no escaping that data produced wears the signature of the producer), and as such, we should expect it to fail and make mistakes with the same voracious confidence that we do.
